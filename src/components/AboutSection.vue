                        Hi there! I’m M. Durai Raj, a passionate and innovative software developer with 2 years of
                        experience in designing and delivering cutting-edge web solutions. I specialize in building
                        scalable, maintainable, and elegant systems using modern technologies and best practices like
                        SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and Microservices Architecture.

                        I thrive in Agile environments, where I can adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver
                        high-quality software solutions. My expertise lies in .NET Core, ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API, REST
                        API, Entity Framework Core, Vue.js, and SQL Server, and I have hands-on experience in CI/CD
                        pipelines using Bamboo and Bitbucket and managing IIS (Internet Information Services) for
                        seamless deployment and optimal performance of web applications.

                        I’m passionate about crafting clean, modular, and extensible code that not only solves problems
                        but also stands the test of time. Let’s connect and build the future of software together!
